# Applied internships app

A web app I built to keep track of all the internships I've appplied to.  
You can view it at https://applied-internships.netlify.app/ (haven't gotten ssl certificate on the server, so you might experience some errors).  

It uses a MERN stack: MariaDB, Express, React, NodeJs
